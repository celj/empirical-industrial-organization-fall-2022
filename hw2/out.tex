%  Body of the article
Suppose there are two firms, \(A\) and \(B\), that simultaneously decide
whether to enter in the market \(m \in \{1, \dots, M\}\) or not. If firm
\(i \in \{A, B\}\) decides to enter, its profits are given by

\[
\Pi_{i, m} = X_{i, m} \beta - D_{j, m} \alpha + \nu_m + u_{i, m}, \qquad \forall\ i, j \in \{A, B\},\ i \neq j
\]

where \(X_{i, m}\) is an observable characteristic of firm \(i\) that
boosts profits in market \(m\), \(D_{j, m} \in \{0, 1\}\) is \(j\)'s
decision of entering the market, \(\nu_m\) is a market fixed effect, and
\(u_{i, m}\) captures unobserved idiosyncratic shocks to profits.

On the other hand, if firm \(i\) decides not to enter market \(m\), its
profits are zero.

Notice that \(u_{i, m}\) is observed by \(i\) but not by its opponent
\(j\). Consequently, the firms are playing an incomplete information
entry game.
