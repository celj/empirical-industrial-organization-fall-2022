# Research Question

<b class="emphasized">What is the impact of private higher education in the Mexican labor market?</b>

# Motivation

- To question the distinct higher education models and their relationship with firms within the <b class="emphasized">labor market</b>
- To purport that there exists a higher probability to be hired by a <b class="emphasized">top-level firm</b> if you graduated from a <b class="emphasized">private university</b>
- To model a relationship between schools, individual and firms using <b class="emphasized">random graphs</b>
- To build a brand new <b class="emphasized">inequality index</b> based on education to be potentially replicated in developing economies

# Social Capital Theory

1. <b class="emphasized">Resource:</b> anything that allows someone to get something done
2. <b class="emphasized">Topology:</b> people and their relationships --- who determine the quality, diversity, and amount of resources you can potentially access
3. <b class="emphasized">Nature of relationships:</b> you, your preferences, and your ability to build a relationship --- trust, trustworthiness, norms, obligations, expectations, or feelings of closeness

# Literature Review

- A significant fraction of all jobs are found through <b class="emphasized">social networks</b>
- The <b class="emphasized">employment situation</b> of individuals that are connected, either directly or indirectly, is correlated
- The <b class="emphasized">topology</b> of the network influences the length and correlation of <b class="emphasized">unemployment</b> among individuals
- The size of the space of <b class="emphasized">estimation can be greatly reduced</b> by reformulating network formation as a distribution over the space of sufficient statistics instead of the space of networks

# Model

Probability of observing network $g$

$$
p (g; \beta) = \frac{\exp(\beta \cdot S(g))}{\sum_{g'} \exp(\beta \cdot S(g'))},
$$

where $S(g) = \left[ S_{\circ} (g), S_{-}(g), S_{\triangle} (g) \right]$

## {data-background-iframe="https://observablehq.com/embed/@utopiah/visualizating-social-vr-contact-tracing?cells=chartFromUrl"}

## The MLE solves

$$
\hat{\beta} = \arg\max_\beta \beta \cdot s - \log \left[ \sum_{s'} \exp(\beta \cdot s') \right]
$$

# Data

The data may not be publicly available, so we need to conduct a <b class="emphasized">survey</b> across multiple universities to obtain it

1. Where do/did you study?
2. To which of the following firms have you applied for a job? $(A)$
3. From which of the above have you received a job offer? $(B)$
4. In which of the above firms have you worked? $(C)$

. . .

Note that $A \supseteq B \supseteq C$
