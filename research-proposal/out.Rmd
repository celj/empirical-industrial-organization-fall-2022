# Research question

<b class="emphasized">What is the impact of private higher education in the Mexican labor market?</b>

# Motivation

- To question the distinct higher education models and their relationship with firms within the <b class="emphasized">labor market</b>
- To purport that there exists a higher probability to be hired by a <b class="emphasized">top-level firm</b> if you graduated from a <b class="emphasized">private university</b>
- To model a relationship between schools, individual and firms using <b class="emphasized">random graphs</b>
- To build a brand new <b class="emphasized">inequality index</b> based on education to be potentially replicated in developing economies
